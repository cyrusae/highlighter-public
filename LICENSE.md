LGPL-3.0-or-later

([this is the Lesser GPL](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html). I am aware that the GNU is canonically judging me for this; I do not care.)

**tl;dr:** 
- Nothing that happens to you as a result of using this software is my fault and I make no promises about support or maintenance
- Using this software means you have to credit me for its creation (i.e. attribution if used as a library)
- Bibliographic citation in works that make use of it is additionally appreciated
- If you make software based on `highlighter` that would have some kind of public release, it must be licensed under these or similar terms (e.g. don't make a public fork, scrub my name off, and try to sell it to people) 
- If there's a loophole in this tl;dr that is not present in the LGPL writeup, the LGPL version of the terms apply. That said,

If you're here because you want to use `highlighter` and you're not opposed to admitting I wrote it your use case is probably fine.
